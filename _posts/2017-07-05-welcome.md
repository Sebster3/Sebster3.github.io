It's about time... seriously! I've been 'working' on this for so long that I wasn't sure I'd actually get around to finishing and publishing the first pancake. My goal with this site is to:

- Provide a place for me to vent/think out loud (read: open journal)
- Work on my writing skills
- Share (hopefully) insightful thoughts
- Act as a portfolio/gallery of my work

So, welcome! I can't yet guarantee the frequency of my writing on here but I will do my best to keep things fresh. I do quite a bit of reading on web development techniques so I'll definitely be sharing that from time to time.
