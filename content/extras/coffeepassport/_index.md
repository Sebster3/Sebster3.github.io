My thoughts on the coffee shops, cafes, and other places I've been to that serve coffee.

A one-star place is a last resort. On the other hand, I would seek out a five-star place to spend my time at, try multiple drinks/pastries, and highly recommend! Five stars doesn't mean "perfect" --- because nothing is --- but it does get the highest marks.
