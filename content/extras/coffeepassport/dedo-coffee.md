Dedo coffee is a relatively new spot in Long Beach that features a warm interior space with plenty of natural light. There's a generous amount of patio seating if the handful of tables inside are taken, and the glass for-here cups are **very** satisfying to hold and drink from.

The menu is simple enough, so I went for the mocha which had a rich flavor and velvety texture, but I didn't get to try any of the pastries since they ran out. I spent nearly two hours playing some games by the large window (not seen in photo), and enjoyed the overall vibe. This feels like a potential five-star spot, but we won't know until we try the pastries. I'll be back for sure :)
