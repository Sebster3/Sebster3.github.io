I've tried quitting TikTok once before and was eventually sucked back in, but this time should be easier.

## "It's just an app, it's not that deep."

Except, it is. This app demands so much of our precious time, and uses our own psychology against us in the process.

I didn't like how much time I'd lose rotting away on the couch. Sure, I liked _some_ of the content I would get, and I'll miss being exposed to niche interests, but I imagine most of us can't remember 90% of what we watch on the app. I get a cheap thrill in the moment, and have nothing to show for the time spent.

_Sidebar: I understand constant productivity is both unhealthy and unsustainable. I shouldn't expect myself to be constantly \*producing\*. That's another battle I'm fighting._

I also noticed I would be in a near constant state of fear, anger, etc. with the state-of-affairs content that would consume my feed. I got numb to the tonal whiplash of videos I'd scroll past. I'd be pissed off in one moment, then laughing my ass off the next. The feeling was unnatural and I knew I hated it but I couldn't look away.

## So, I decided to delete TikTok... _again_.

The app was nearing it's shutdown date imposed by the current administration, and figured I should be the one to decide when I no longer use the app. It felt like the right thing to do, so I went cold turkey. As addictions go, I didn't last very long and joined back up when I saw that the shutdown was delayed. Fast-forward to today, and I think I'm in a better mindset to pull away from TikTok again.

I still use Reels (the lesser of two evils) so I haven't given up _all_ short-form content. Reels doesn't give me the same addictive feeling, so it's easier to put the app down. The app is also much less political, so I don't find myself getting angry as much. This has the double-edge effect of keeping me out of the loop with current events.

## Staying informed and other activities
I've started following a few sources via RSS to stay informed: NPR, News Minimalist, and BBC News to name a few. It's not the hyper-local coverage I've come to expect from TikTok, but it's better than burying my head in the sand. I've also slowly been following a few interest-based feeds and some personal blogs. I'm really enjoying the exposure to personal written content in particular, and I might publish a list of sources later on.

So that's it. I've dumped TikTok, hopefully for good, in favor of spending more time reading about other people's interests, issues, and hell even [combatdavey's](https://combatdavey.net/blog) **daily** blog posts about life. How do they keep it up!?

I'm also taking this extra time to work on other goals. I've started going to the gym in the morning, and I've started reading the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). I use git all the time, so it's about time I really learn the fundamentals instead of relying on my patchwork knowledge. Maybe I'll start studying for the Network+ or Security+ cert again ðŸ‘€.

It's been chill so far.
