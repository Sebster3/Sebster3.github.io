We're better off making mistakes than doing nothing at all.

The idea behind [consistent messy action](https://medium.com/@mari_brown/messy-action-is-still-action-why-imperfect-progress-is-the-key-to-success-176e30612e5a) is to make frequent progress towards a goal no matter how big or small the progress is. Writing a book? Write a paragraph. Haven't been to the doctor in over a decade? Call for information.

The goal isn't to make huge leaps at a time or for it to be perfect every time. That paragraph could end up getting scrapped entirely. The doctor's office may not take your insurance. It's fine. You've made progress and that's what's important.

With that in mind, rather than continue to spend countless indecisive hours trying to iron out this site before it's ready, and thus never will be, let's do some messy action: The first post.

My goals for this site are simple. It'll be a place where I share what's going on in life, mull over thoughts, and practice consistent, small progress. If that sounds remotely interesting, pop in from time to time for the latest on _whatever the heck_ is new here.

Until the next time, welcome and thanks for stopping by :)
