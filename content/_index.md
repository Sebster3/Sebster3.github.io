Hi There, I'm Sebastien!

This'll be a place where I share what's going on in life, mull over thoughts, and practice consistent, small progress. If that sounds remotely interesting, pop in from time to time for the latest on _whatever the heck_ is new here.

Read (a bit) more in my [first post](/posts/consistent-messy-action).

## What's New: The Coffee Passport

The new [Coffee Passport](/extras/coffeepassport) section is up! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts on the coffee shops, cafes, and other places I've been to that serve coffee. The Coffee Passport features a rating for each entry, a recommendation or two, and some quick thoughts on the place. Also, as an avid decaf drinker, I make note of whether decaf is available.

The [first entry](/extras/coffeepassport/dedo-coffee) is for Dedo Coffee, a chill spot in Long Beach :)
