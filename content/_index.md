Hi There, I'm Sebastien!

This'll be a place where I share what's going on in life, mull over thoughts, and practice consistent, small progress. If that sounds remotely interesting, pop in from time to time for the latest on _whatever the heck_ is new here.

Read (a bit) more in my [first post](/posts/consistent-messy-action).

<!-- I'm a Desktop Field Tech solving problems and "turning it off and on" since December 2024. I've also been ripping my blu-ray collection to a Plex server, learning to play Pickleball, and playing a [game](/interests/video-games) or [two](/interests/board-games). -->
